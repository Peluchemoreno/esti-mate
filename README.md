# Esti-Mate

## To-dos

- [x] show a green line when the line is vertical or horizontal
- [ ] currently all vertical and horizontal lines turn green >:(
- [ ] calculate line distances based on the current device width (maybe a percentage based ratio dependent on the device width)
- [ ] mobile version create project modal scrolls weird, need to fix

### Mouseup/Touchup

- [x] revert the color of the line back to its original color
- [ ] show the length of the line next to the line

### Mousedown/Touchstart

- [ ] snap the position of the current start coordinates to the closest existing line
